The wavy water of Bay of Bengal touches the beach throughout this 120 km.For Bangladeshi`s it doesn`t get much better than Cox`s Bazar, the country`s most popular beach town than the other one Kuakata beach town.

The beach is only a bit crowded in tourist season, October to March, especially near the hotel-motel zone, but remains virgin during the rest of the year, April to September, when it`s better to take a trip there.',
